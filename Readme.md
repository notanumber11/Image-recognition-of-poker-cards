# Image processing with OpenCV - playing cards recognition.

The aim of the project is creating the general application to detect set of player poker cards in photo using OpenCV library and Python programming platform as modern technologies and techniques as feature extractor, contours detection, K-nearest, pixel descriptor, color extraction and adaptive thresholding have been recognized and implemented.<br>

A detailed explanation of the full project can be found in the document <b> 
Playing cards recognition.pdf </b>.

## Final bachelor project
